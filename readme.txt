This project is to demostrate how to use Firebase Phone auth using Bloc Pattern.

First i created a bloc using cubit where i define two files. First one is auth_cubit where we define all required function for the project and second file is auth_state where we 
manage the states.

The project login using phone no and received OTP. After verifiying the OTP app allow you to login where we can see the user details which we entered at the 
time of sign up.
